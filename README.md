# Credit-Risk-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning-Models

**Overview**
This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze and predict credit risk based on borrower profiles and loan characteristics. The goal is to classify loan applications as low-risk or high-risk using historical credit data.

**Objectives**
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on credit data.
Build and evaluate multiple classification models for credit risk prediction.
Compare model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC.

**Technologies Used**
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data processing
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization
Scikit-learn – Machine Learning models
Imbalanced-learn – Handling class imbalance
Jupyter Notebook – Development environment
